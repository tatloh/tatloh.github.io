I plan to create my own local webpages that I can aggregate all my housing expenses and display them in one place for easy tracking and monitoring of keep our housing expeses within budget. I also plan to have an investment dashboard that will input in all our current investments to help my family manage our finances together, both revenue and expenses.</p>
